<body>

	The GraphicLoader package is designed to provide support for
	GraphicLoaders, which in turn are objects that need to drive changes in
	OMGraphics over a map.  The GraphicLoader is an object that manages
	OMGraphics and their positions, and sends an OMGraphicList to its
	receiver when they need to be updated. <P>

		The package consists of a GraphicLoaderLayer, which is a layer that accepts
		graphics from another object, called the GraphicLoader.  The GraphicLoader
		is an object with a timer that manages these location objects. The
		GraphicLoaderConnector is an object that should be added to the
		MapHander - when it finds a GraphicLoader in the MapHandler, it will
		automatically create a GraphicLoaderLayer for it, and
		will give it to the LayerHandler if it
		knows about one, or give the GraphicLoaderLayer to the MapHandler so
		it can be found by the LayerHandler later.<P>

		To add a GraphicLoader to the OpenMap application, you can do it
		several ways:
	<UL>
		<LI>You can create a specific GraphicLoaderLayer that creates its
			own GraphicLoader, and initializes it accordingly.  You would add
			the GraphicLoaderLayer to the openmap.layers property in the
			openmap.properties file.
		<LI>You can create a GraphicLoaderLayer by adding an entry to the
			openmap.layer property in the openmap.properties file, and define
			what kind of GraphicLoader to create in the properties for the
			GraphicLoaderLayer.
		<LI>You can add a
			com.bbn.openmap.layer.graphicLoader.GraphicLoaderConnector to the
			openmap.components property, and then add the GraphicLoader to the
			openmap.components property as well.  The GraphicLoaderConnector
			will find the GraphicLoader, and create a
			GraphicLoaderLayer for the GraphicLoader and add it to
			the LayerHandler on top of the map.
	</UL>
