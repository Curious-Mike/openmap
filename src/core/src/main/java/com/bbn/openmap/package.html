<body>

The com.bbn.openmap package contains the core OpenMap classes.  The
classes in this package provide the main map management functionality
of OpenMap.<P>

The main mapping window is the MapBean, which is a JComponent.  It
contains Layers, each layer providing a thematic overlay to
the map.  There are three flavors of MapBeans:  MapBean, BufferedMapBean, 
and BufferedLayerMapBean.  You should use the BufferedLayerMapBean, it 
is an extension of BufferedMapBean with the added feature of putting 
'background' layers into a single buffer at the back of the map, 
and controlling map paints to occur when those layers are 
ready.  This feature prevents the map from having a flashing effect 
observed when slower layers with more things on the map paint after 
faster layers with less.  The MapBeanRepaintPolicy components let you 
make modifications to the MapBean rendering - adding anti-aliasing, etc.
<P>

The other main component is the MapHandler.  The MapHandler is an
extended BeanContext, and can be thought of as the widget holding to
all the components that make up a map.  As a BeanContext, the
MapHandler keeps a handle to any object that is put in it, providing
access to all components of the map.  Any component can be added to
the MapHandler.  Any component added to the MapHandler that is a
BeanContextMembershipListener will be automatically notified when any
component is added or removed from the MapHandler.  See the
MapHandlerChild abstract class for more information about creating a
class that uses the MapHandler to locate other needed components.<P>

The extensions to the MapHandler that separate it from a regular
BeanContext really center on the notion that some components can
implement the SoloMapComponent interface.  SoloMapComponents classes
are objects where only one instance of them can be found in a
MapHandler.  The SoloMapComponentPolicy assigned to the MapHandler
lets it know what to do when a duplicate instance of a
SoloMapComponent is given to the MapHandler - either rejection or
replacement are the only options currently provided.<P>

Other components of real interest are:
<UL>
<LI>LayerHandler - manages all layers for the map, those active or
not.
<LI>MouseDelegator - manages how MouseEvents over the map are directed
to layers or other components.
<LI>PropertyConsumer - components that can be configured using Java 
Properties.  The OpenMap application uses a properties file to configure 
its components, allowing you to add or change components and their 
behavior without having to update code.
<LI>PropertyHandler - uses properties to configure the application
<LI>InformationDelegator - an object that other components can use to
provide information to the user.
<LI>OMComponent - a base class for classes that are PropertyConsumers 
and also use the MapHandler to locate other components.
<LI>ProjectionPainter - interface for objects that want to draw on top 
of the map after the layers have been rendered.  Useful for quickly rendering
things on top of the map.
</UL>
