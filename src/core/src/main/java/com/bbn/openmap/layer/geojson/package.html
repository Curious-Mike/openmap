The geojson layer package contains components used to display geojson files in OpenMap.  The 
main geojson decoding files are derivative works frome the GeoJSON Jackson project available at:
https://github.com/opendatalab-de/geojson-jackson.
<P>
The GeoJSONObject and subclasses from that package have been modified to include a convert() method that
makes it easier to convert GeoJSONObjects to OMGraphics.  There was also a modification to GeoJSONObject 
to make 'metadata' tags optional.
<P>
The GeoJSON jackson classes have also been repackaged into the com.bbn.openmap.layer.geojson package for 
organizational purposes.
